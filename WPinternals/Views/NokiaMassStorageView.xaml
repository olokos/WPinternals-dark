But those are blocked by Mass Storage mode, so this tool is not able to reboot your phone to normal mode. But this is not a problem. To escape from Mass Storage mode you have to perform a soft-reset. Older Lumia models require you to press and hold the volume-down-button and the power-button at the same time for at least 10 seconds. New Lumia models only require to press and hold the power-button for 10 seconds. This will trigger a power-cycle and the phone will reboot. Once fully booted, the phone may show strange behavior, like complaining about mail-accounts, showing old text-messages, inability to load https-websites, etc. This is expected behavior, because the time-settings of the phone are incorrect. Just wait a few seconds for the phone to get a data-connection and have the date/time synced. After that the strange behavior will stop automatically and normal operation is resumed." />
